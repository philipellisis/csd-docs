This is actually a great solution if you want to get started with a low cost and simple to install alternative to having a control board with DOF to configure, but in order to use in FX, you do still need to have popper installed, which means a bit of software configuration. It also only provides feedback to major table events in FX, so that means things link the ball rolling effect and most of the \"little\" effects that are really great in VPX do not exist for most FX tables. It is very easy to get working with VPX, and the experience in VPX is simply amazing, so it's an extremely popular choice if you are already enjoying VPX and want to add some more realism to it. Some will say it's a better investment than solenoids for VPX and I agree so as long as you get the higher quality speakers (which are included in all my kits)."),(0,r.kt)("h3",{id:"builders-kits"},"Builders Kits"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/virtual-pinball-builders-kit"},"Builders Kits")," are the (almost) all inclusive kits that give you the ability to get a fairly comprehensive pinball machine in one simple to install package.
