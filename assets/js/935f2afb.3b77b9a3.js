Connecting them is quite simple, but unlike most items that you connect, where polarity is only important for proper operation, connecting the strobes with the wrong polarity can cause damage to the expansion board or the strobes, so be very careful to connect them the right way.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/intro":{"id":"BuildersKit/intro","title":"Overview of the Builders kits","description":"The builders kits come with most of my products, all wired and ready to put into your cabinet!
