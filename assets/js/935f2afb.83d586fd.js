that extend to the side of the cabinet for connecting the flipper buttons.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/connecting-button-expansion":{"id":"BuildersKit/connecting-button-expansion","title":"Connecting Service or Button Expansion

The Builders kit comes with a service board.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/connecting-expansion-board":{"id":"BuildersKit/connecting-expansion-board","title":"Connecting the Expansion Board","description":"The expansion board connects to the power supply just like the main board does, just plug 12v directly into it as shown below","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/connecting-knocker":{"id":"BuildersKit/connecting-knocker","title":"Connecting the Knocker","description":"The knocker is also not included in the kits, but is a nice option to add and comes pre-wired and ready to plug in if added to any of the kits. The knocker also needs to be connected to the 12v supply, and also uses one of the low power signal outputs on the PinOne Main board","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/connecting-lightbar":{"id":"BuildersKit/connecting-lightbar","title":"Connecting the Light Bar","description":"Connecting the light bar to the expansion board is as simple as connecting the 2 meter 20 pin ribbon cable between the expansion board and the light bar.

It doesn\'t really matter which one you connect it to as both are electrically the same, but normally it\'s easier to connect it to the button board since it is near the front of the cabinet.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/connecting-shaker":{"id":"BuildersKit/connecting-shaker","title":"Connecting the Shaker","description":"The shaker plugs right into the main board via the 3 pin connector. You can adjust the shaker motor speed by adjusting the small dial on the board (circled below)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/connecting-solenoid-bars":{"id":"BuildersKit/connecting-solenoid-bars","title":"Connecting the Solenoid Bars","description":"For the extreme kit and medium kits, the kit comes with two 3 pin cables for the 2 solenoid bars and two 4 pin cables for the 3 solenoid bars.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/connecting-strobes":{"id":"BuildersKit/connecting-strobes","title":"Connecting the Strobes","description":"Strobes do not come with the builders kit, but are a great addition to the kit, so really worth adding to it if you want to round off the experience. Connecting them is quite simple, but unlike most items that you connect, where polarity is only important for proper operation, connecting the strobes with the wrong polarity can cause damage to the expansion board or the strobes, so be very careful to connect them the right way.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"BuildersKit/intro":{"id":"BuildersKit/intro","title":"Overview of the Builders kits","description":"The builders kits come with most of my products, all wired and ready to put into your cabinet!
