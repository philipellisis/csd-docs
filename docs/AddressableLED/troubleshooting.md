# Troubleshooting

### Windows doesn't recognize both boards or boards are re-arranged

if your boards don't both get recognized by windows or they are re-arranged after startup then you can try using something like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L32B9C2 as a way to set them in their right place. Some motherboards don't seem to do a good job of keeping track of the ids of usb devices and keeping them straight so something like that can seem to help out.
