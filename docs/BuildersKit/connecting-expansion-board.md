# Connecting the Expansion Board

The expansion board connects to the power supply just like the main board does, just plug 12v directly into it as shown below

Next connect the 4 pin 10cm cable from the main board to the expansion board. The jumper on the expansion board should be in the first position to ensure that the outputs are tied to the "expansion board 1" tab on the outputs section in the config tool.
