# Connecting the Strobes

Strobes do not come with the builders kit, but are a great addition to the kit, so really worth adding to it if you want to round off the experience. Connecting them is quite simple, but unlike most items that you connect, where polarity is only important for proper operation, connecting the strobes with the wrong polarity can cause damage to the expansion board or the strobes, so be very careful to connect them the right way.
