# Installing DOF

You can install DOF using the installer found here: [32bit DOF Installer](./files/DOFSetup.msi) [64bit DOF Installer](./files/DOFSetup.msi)

When installing the 64 bit version, make sure to place it in a different directory from the 32 bit version if you intend on running both at the same time. You will also need to manually update the plugins shortcut that is normally created for you when installing the 64 bit version if you want to be able to run both to ensure all the links are in the right place.
