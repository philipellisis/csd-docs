# Installing DOF

In order to get the LATEST version of DOF, I highly recommend to install from here and not from anywhere else you might find installers on the internet. These are the latest builds of DOF that include important security updates as well as bug fixes and device compatibility that are not available from any other sources that I am aware of at this time.

You can install DOF using the installers found here. Make sure you select the correct version based on the install of VPX on your PC (64 or 32 bit)

Released December 28th 2024 - version 3.2.9
- [32bit DOF Installer](https://github.com/philipellisis/DirectOutput/releases/latest/download/DOFSetup.msi) 
- [64bit DOF Installer](https://github.com/philipellisis/DirectOutput/releases/latest/download/DOFSetup64.msi)

## Installing both 32 bit and 64 bit DOF
Run both installers, and make sure they are both installed in the same location (it will default to your C:/DirectOutput directory) When DOF is installed, they will automatically create directories for x86 (32 bit version) and x64 (64 bit version).
