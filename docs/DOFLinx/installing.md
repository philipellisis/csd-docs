- Next unzip all the files

- Open the unzipped directory and move all the files (not all folders) into your DirectOutput/x86 OR /64 bit directory.

- Move the files inside the ```32 bit``` folder into the DirectOutput x86 folder, and the files inside the ```64 bit``` directory inside the x64 bit folder (if applicable)

- Next unzip all the other directories into ```C:\DirectOutput\``` (or wherever you have installed DOF). The end result should look like this:
