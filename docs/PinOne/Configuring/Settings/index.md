# Settings Menu

The settings screen allows you to adjust all settings for the PinOne in one place. Once you have adjusted the settings, click the "Upload Config" button to save them in memory on the PinOne. This will allow you to see how things work before committing the changes, but if the USB cable is disconnected from the PinOne then your changes will be lost and they will revert to the settings as they were before entering the menu. So save the values permanently, click the "Save Config" button.
