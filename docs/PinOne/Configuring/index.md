Configuring the PinOne board is designed to be extremely simple. Just plug the board into your PC via a USB connection and run the configuration utility. The most recent version can always be fetched directly [here](./files/CSDControllerTool.zip) Once running, click the `connect` button and you should see all the options appear on the menu so you can easily test and configure the board.
