# Inputs

![image](./img/buttons.png)

## Send button presses

Besides the obvious of being able to see button presses made in the PinOne board when in this screen, it also provides a way to send button inputs out to the computer that are not generally easy to send like the accelerometer left, right, up, down, and the plunger up, down as well as the plunger button press if configured. This allows you to setup the PinOne board in steam and properly assign inputs to each of the different controller functions.

## Send Keyboard Presses

Next to each button is the option to set a keyboard keypress for each button input. When set, this will send a keyboard keystroke as well as the button press with each press of a button. This can be helpful for games that don't support a game controller or if you want to use a standard set of keys with the PinOne.

## Debounce

This can be set for buttons in case you don't want them to be as sensitive to fast button presses. This is not recommended for the flipper buttons but can be helpful for some of the menu buttons to prevent accidentally double tapping them.
