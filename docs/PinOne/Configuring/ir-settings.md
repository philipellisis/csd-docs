# IR Settings

![image](./img/ir.png)

## Setting IR functionality

Use this section to choose the output that will be set for the IR signal to be sent to. You can only set one command to be sent (this is normally the power on event). You can choose from the predefined list or just type in your own IR hex code to be used. The button mapped to the IR setting when pushed, will send the command to the output. 

## Recommended IR LED

I have used the Adafruit IR emitter and it worked great: [Link to product](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5639)
