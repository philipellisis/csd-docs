# Older PinOne Firmware

### How to update firmware with older PinOne boards if I can't use the reset button

If you want to update the firmware without the reset button on one of the older PinOne boards, you can still do it but you will need to use the older config tool (I keep it up to date for firmware updates only).

1. Download the older PinOne config tool from here: [Config Tool](https://github.com/philipellisis/virtual-pinball-board-configurator/releases)

2. Use this video to help get the firmware installed in case you have issues: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/PnpEjDExmgg?t=112)

3. Once you have the firmware updated, you can use the new config tool for all your configuration
