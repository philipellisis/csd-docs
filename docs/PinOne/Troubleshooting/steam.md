# Steam Issues

### Game controller no longer recognized in Steam

Note that the latest update in Steam breaks controller support for many different controllers, and the PinOne is one of them. There are two ways to get around this. One is to unplug the USB game controller and plug it back in while the Steam client is open. Another solution is simply updating to the Beta version of Steam as it appears to resolve the issue.

Looking through the comments below, it appears it has affected a lot of people so hopefully the issue is resolved in the next full update: https://steamcommunity.com/app/593110/eventcomments/6536492434601842757?ctp=5
