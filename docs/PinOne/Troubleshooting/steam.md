# Steam Issues

### Game controller no longer recognized in Steam

Note that the latest update in Steam breaks controller support for many different controllers, and the PinOne is one of them. There are two ways to get around this. One is to unplug the USB game controller and plug it back in while the Steam client is open.

Looking through the comments below, it appears it has affected a lot of people so hopefully the issue is resolved in the next full update: https://steamcommunity.com/app/593110/eventcomments/6536492434601842757?ctp=5

### Game controller won't work in games

This is likely because the game does not have steam input enabled. To enable steam input follow the below steps:
 1. Navigate to the game library in steam and click on the game you want to use the PinOne game controller with
 2. Click on the gear icon for the game settings and select "properties"
 3. Inside the game settings, click the "Controller" settings
 4. Select "Enable Steam Input" for the override.
