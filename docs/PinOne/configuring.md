# PinOne Configuration

Configuring the PinOne board is designed to be extremely simple. Just plug the board into your PC via a USB connection and run the configuration utility. The most recent version can always be fetched from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/philipellisis/virtual-pinball-board-configurator/releases) On that page, just download and run the `CSDControllerTool.exe`. Once running, click the `connect` button and you should see all the options appear on the menu so you can easily test and configure the board.
