# PinOne

## Introduction

The [PinOne board](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/pinone-control-board) is a new offering to the pinball community, it is an open source project that is fully supported by the Arduino platform and can be compiled and built on the [ATmega32U4](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega32u4) microchip. It has a number of offerings that are not currently available in Pinscape and is much easier to configure. More details about the features can be read about in the next section.
