# PinOne

## Introduction

The PinOne board is a new offering to the pinball community, it is an open source project that is fully supported by the Arduino platform and can be compiled and built on the [atmega32u4](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega32u4) microchip. It has a number of offerings that are not currently available in Pinscape, is much easier to configure, but does sacrifice a bit of configuration that can be done on the Pinscape board. More details about the features can be read about in the next section
