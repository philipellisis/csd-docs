# Pinup Popper Setup

### Controller menu navigation (Controller Setup)

In order to properly navigate through the menus I have highlighted the buttons that are needed. There are other shortcut buttons that can be utilized, but I have found most of these options just overcomplicate navigation. All you really need is a button to select, a button to exit and a button to navigate around. For more complex setups more menu options might be necessary.
