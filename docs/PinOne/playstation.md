# Playstation 5

To use the PinOne controller with a Playstation 5, you need to install the x-input firmware and purchase an adapter to play it with. My customers have found this one to work well: [PS5 Adapter](https://www.brookaccessory.com/products/wingmanfgc2/index.html)

You then just need to activate on the PS5 "Use Second Controller for Assistance" to navigate in the game with a secondary controller (two controllers on a single profile).
