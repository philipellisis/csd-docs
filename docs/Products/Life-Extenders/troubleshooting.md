### Fuse blowing on life extender

1. First check the small dial on the life extender. Make sure it is all the way turned counter clockwise, then about 1/4 turn up from there. If it is turned up clockwise too much, it will actually blow the fuse.

2. If the life extender is set properly then the life extender could actually be bad. This should be easy to find out which one it is. Just hit the flipper button that activates it or turn the output on through the config tool and keep it turned on for several seconds. If the life extender is bad, then the fuse will blow after holding it for a longer period of time. Also the solenoid will likely get a bit hotter than the one with the good life extender.
