# Configuring for Pinball FX3

The configuration of VPX in FX3 is a little more complicated, but the end result is worth it. In order to install, you first need to have pinup popper, DOF and DOFLinx installed. If you don't have this yet, then head over to these sites to get started:

[Pinpup Popper](https://www.nailbuster.com/wikipinup/doku.php?id=baller_installer)

[DOF Installer](http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/dll-updates.html)

[DOFLinx](https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=12318)

Now that you have the necessary software installed, it's time to load the configuration files.

1. Download the DOFLinx SSF files from here: [FX3 PuP Packs](https://vpuniverse.com/files/file/5999-fx3-ssf-surround-sound-feedback-pup-packs/)

2. Next all you need to do is extract and copy the ```Completed FX3 SSF PuP Packs``` file over to your PuP Video directory (typically ```C:/{PuPInstallLocation}/PuPVideos```)

3. lastly, in your DOFLinx.ini file, ensure the ```PATH_FX3``` is pointing to the PUPPlayer location (typically ```PATH_FX3=C:\DirectOutput\FX3_PUPlayer\```)
