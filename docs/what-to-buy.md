# DIY Cabinet Options
Below are all the parts needed to build all the internals of a pinball cabinet along with the individual "cabinet components" that will be needed to add specific features

### Main board and buttons ("The essentials")

If you just want a super simple cabinet with buttons, then I offer the "PinOne Mini" which you can get the PinOne Mini board below.
For a simple buttons and nudge only setup then you can select the "No Power Boards" option and save some money, or you can get the option with the power boards to allow you to add two solenoids to the setup really easily. In both cases you will want the option with the PinOne board included unless you already have one for some reason. Note that in the future you can always upgrade the PinOne mini to include all the features of the PinOne main by simply add the [PinOne expansion board](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/pinone-mini-expansion-board) 

For both boards I recommend adding 5 RGB buttons (2 for flippers, 2 for magna save and 1 for the fire button) and at least 4 single color LED buttons.

- [RGB Buttons](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/rgb-leaf-button)
- [LED Buttons](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/rgb-leaf-button-3hwee)

For the larger cabinet setup, I recommend the PinOne main board along with the button board for the button inputs. This will allow you to also connect solenoids to the setup really easily. For the button board, you don't need an expansion board to operate it with the PinOne so you only need to add the buttons and you are good to go.

### If you want a real plunger

You have a few options here. If you are getting the main board or mini board separately (mentioned above) then you should just get the "plunger only" option. If you just want a standalone plunger "kit" that you can use with your system without having to purchase anything else, then you can get the full plunger kit and it comes with the PinOne mini board. In either case you have the option of also getting a Williams style plunger included in the kit or just the board (you will need to provide the physical plunger, which if you have a Legends Pinball cabinet or Arcade 1up, then this plunger board will mount to it)

### If you want solenoids

For the life extenders, always pick the "common terminal positive" option so they work with my parts. You can add up to 10 solenoids. For a 10 solenoid setup, get 2 two position boards and 2 three position boards. For 8 solenoids, get 2 four position boards, for 6 solenoids, 2 three position boards.

- [Power supply](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/12v-10a-power-supply-with-cord)

### If you want a shaker motor

I HIGHLY Recommend the shaker motor to anyone playing Visual Pinball games. It's one of my favorite toys!

If you already have the PinOne Main board, then the shaker motor will connect directly to it, so all you need is a power supply and the shaker motor itself. No need to get the full kit as the shaker motor and housing is all that is needed. The full kit is for setups where you already have everything in place and you don't want to bother trying to add to your system or you are only adding a shaker motor and a couple of other toys.

- [Shaker Motor and Housing](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/ultimate-pinball-shaker-motor)
- [Power supply](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/12v-10a-power-supply-with-cord)

If you already have a SSF bass shaker, you will still get a lot of benefit from the shaker motor. Here are the differences of each of them:

The real pinball shaker motor is triggered by DOF enabled pinball events, so it will only go off for certain events happening on the table and is actually going to shake the cabinet in a significant way. It is used infrequently but is enabled for most VPX tables and adds a lot to the experience.

The exciters makes audible noise -- it is essentially a speaker but it uses your cabinet to make the sound so there is resonance that you can feel. They are typically quite small though so the amount of feeling is usually not much.

bass shaker is a large exciter that makes very little actual sound but will move the cabinet from audio signals. Since the exciters and the bass shaker are receiving the same audio signal, it adds a lot of punch to the feel from the exciters that are mounted on the side of the cabinet. These emulate the feeling of pop bumpers and other large solenoids going off in the cabinet that you aren't able to emulate through the smaller exciters very well.

### To add a light bar

For the light bar, you will need an expansion board. The PinOne only supports the 16 output version for the light bar. You can also optionally add the strobes to the light bar as they plug right into the back of it

- [Strobes](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/rgb-12v-virtual-pinball-light-bar-sr8y4)

### SSF

Surround Sound Feedback in Visual Pinball is extremely immersive, and potentially better feedback than solenoids can ever give you if done right. In this case, I provide everything you need for one of the best SSF experiences in your cabinet.

For a larger cabinet the 4.2 option is a good way to go, but for most cabinets the 2.1 channel option is more than enough. If you also want to power your backbox speakers with the same amplifier, I offer it as an add on to the SSF Kit and it comes pre-wired and ready to plug in so it works all together.

### Knocker

If you want to add a knocker to your setup, I offer a nice solution for triggering a knocker and now there is a dedicated output on the PinOne Main board to run it! I do not offer the knocker solenoid as of yet (it is coming soon!)

### Service board

If you want an easy way to access internal cabinet functions like volume up/down, and other service functions, then the service board plugs right into both the PinOne main and the PinOne mini boards

### Addressable LEDs

Adding Addressable LEDs to your machine has never been easier, my board feeds all the power directly to your LED strips so you don't need to solder anything to get it to work. If you purchase my panels, they even come with easy quick connects so you can plug them right into the board. If you want to roll your own setup, then I sell the Addressable LED board separately as well as a few options for the matrix and side rail addressable LEDs. Make sure to get the extension cables for any runs you might want to make in the machine. Most people get the kit with 6 panels, and that leaves two open outputs for speaker rings or something else you might want to add.

### To make a (duplicate) PinOne Mini Machine

I've had customers ask me what parts I use inside the PinOne Mini machine, and you can build your own by getting the following:

- [Plunger](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/virtual-pinball-plunger-attachment) (Get the "plug and play kit" and "williams plunger included" options)
- [RGB Buttons](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/rgb-leaf-button) (get 5 of these)
- [LED Buttons](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/rgb-leaf-button-3hwee) (get 4 of these)

Optional, if you want the solenoid option:
- [Power supply](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/12v-10a-power-supply-with-cord)
- [Solenoids](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/high-quality-solenoid) (2 of these)

The only difference with this setup is the power supply I provide with the PinOne Mini Machine is slightly different, but you would need to mount the plug onto your cabinet to use the one I sell with the PinOne Mini Machine, which is not really simple to do. If this is still something you would like to do, then just ask for the PinOne power supply option when you purchase and I will send it to you.
