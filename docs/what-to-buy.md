# DIY Cabinet Options
Below are all the parts needed to build all the internals of a pinball cabinet along with the individual "cabinet components" that will be needed to add specific features

### Main board and buttons ("The essentials")

If you just want a super simple cabinet with buttons, then I offer the "PinOne Mini" which you can get the PinOne Mini board below.
For a simple buttons and nudge only setup then you can select the "No Power Boards" option and save some money, or you can get the option with the power boards to allow you to add two solenoids to the setup really easily. In both cases you will want the option with the PinOne board included unless you already have one for some reason. Note that in the future you can always upgrade the PinOne mini to include all the features of the PinOne main by simply add the [PinOne expansion board](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/pinone-mini-expansion-board) 

For both boards I recommend adding 5 RGB buttons (2 for flippers, 2 for magna save and 1 for the fire button) and at least 4 single color LED buttons.

- [LED Buttons](https://www.clevelandsoftwaredesign.com/pinball-parts/p/rgb-leaf-button-3hwee)

For the larger cabinet setup, I recommend the PinOne main board along with the button board for the button inputs. This will allow you to also connect solenoids to the setup really easily. For the button board, you don't need an expansion board to operate it with the PinOne so you only need to add the buttons and you are good to go.

### If you want a real plunger

You have a few options here. If you are getting the main board (above) then you can just get the "plunger only" option. If you just want a standalone plunger, then you can get the full plunger kit. In either case you have the option of also getting a Williams style plunger included in the kit or just the board (you will need to provide the physical plunger, which if you have a Legends Pinball cabinet, then this plunger will mount to it)

### If you want solenoids

For the life extenders, always pick the "common terminal positive" option so they work with my parts. You can add up to 10 solenoids. For a 10 solenoid setup, get 2 two position boards and 2 three position boards. For 8 solenoids, get 2 four position boards, for 6 solenoids, 2 three position boards.

### If you want a shaker motor

I HIGHLY Recommend the shaker motor to anyone playing Visual Pinball games. It's one of my favorite toys!

If you already have the PinOne Main board, then the shaker motor will connect directly to it, so all you need is a power supply and the shaker motor itself. No need to get the full kit as the shaker motor and housing is all that is needed. The full kit is for setups where you already have everything in place and you don't want to bother trying to add to your system or you are only adding a shaker motor and a couple of other toys.

### To add a light bar

For the light bar, you will need an expansion board. The PinOne only supports the 16 output version for the light bar. You can also optionally add the strobes to the light bar as they plug right into the back of it

### SSF

Surround Sound Feedback in Visual Pinball is extremely immersive, and potentially better feedback than solenoids can ever give you if done right. In this case, I provide everything you need for one of the best SSF experiences in your cabinet.

For a larger cabinet the 4.2 option is a good way to go, but for most cabinets the 2.1 channel option is more than enough. If you also want to power your backbox speakers with the same amplifier, I offer it as an add on to the SSF Kit and it comes pre-wired and ready to plug in so it works all together.

### Knocker

If you want to add a knocker to your setup, I offer a nice solution for triggering a knocker and now there is a dedicated output on the PinOne Main board to run it! I do not offer the knocker solenoid as of yet (it is coming soon!)

### Service board

If you want an easy way to access internal cabinet functions like volume up/down, and other service functions, then the service board plugs right into both the PinOne main and the PinOne mini boards
